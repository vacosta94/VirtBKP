# Create backup of oVirt / RHEVâ€™s VMs 
[TOC]
## Introduction
I've been working with `oVirt` since version `3.5` as main virtualization platform, from day one i were looking for a tool to create VM backups based on snapshot as many solutions does with `VMWARE`, after some research i didn't find a tool that fulfilled my requirements so i decided to create one using oVirt python API.

## Requirements
- oVirt >= 4.0
- Virtual machine with CentOS 7 with this tools installed, we'll call this VM `bkpvm`
- `bkpvm` should be on the same `oVirt Datacenter` of the VM we need to take backup of
- `bkpvm` should have enought space to store backups
- `Storage Domain` should have enought space to take snapshots

## How does it work?
This script should run on `bkpvm` and it connect to `oVirt API` to do:
- Create snapshot 
- Create snapshot passing disk id
- Attach disk to `bkpvm`
- Create a `qcow2` file of the VM's disk
- Delete snapshot

After finish it creates a `qcow2` file for each VM's disk

## Instalation
#### Prerequisites
Install required repositories on `bkpvm`:
```bash
yum install -y epel-release
yum install -y http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release43.rpm 

```
Install required packages from repositories configured:
```bash
yum install -y qemu-img python-ovirt-engine-sdk4 python-requests git ovirt-guest-agent

```
#### Download 
```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/vacosta94/VirtBKP.git
```
We need to get our oVirt's CA in order to establish secure connections to `oVirt API` 
```bash
cd /opt/VirtBKP
curl --insecure "https://ovirt.infratic.com/ovirt-engine/services/pki-resource?resource=ca-certificate&format=X509-PEM-CA" -o ca.crt
```
## Usage
#### Configure
There is a configuration file `default.conf` inside `VirtBKP` folder, that file have all the parameters required by the tool. Should modify this file according your environment as follow:
```bash 
vim /opt/VirtBKP/default.conf
```
```python
[bkp]
url		= https://ovirt.example.com/ovirt-engine/api
user		= admin@internal
password	= password
ca_file		= ca.crt
bkpvm		= bkpvm
bckdir 		= /mnt/

[restore]
url		= https://ovirt.example.com/ovirt-engine/api
user		= admin@internal
password	= password
ca_file		= ca.crt
storage		= gfs_pool0
proxy		= ovirt.example.com
proxyport	= 54323

[default]
url             = https://ovirt.example.local/ovirt-engine/api
user            = admin@internal
password        = daitarn3$
ca_file         = ca.crt

```
- `url`: `oVirt API` URL
- `user`: `User name`
- `password`: `User password`
- `ca_file`: Path to `ca.crt` 
- `bkpvm`: Name of our `bkpvm`
- `bckdir`: Path to store backups in `.qcow2` format
- `storage`: Storage domain where we'll restore our backups
- `proxy`: `IP` or `hostname` of the `ovirt-image-proxy` host (Default: ovirt-engine)
- `proxyport`: TCP port of the `ovirt-image-proxy` (Default: 54323) 


## Create backup
In order to create backups of virtual machines you should use the syntax bellow:

```bash
/opt/VirtBKP/backup_vm.py <configuration_file> <vm_name> 

```
Example:
```bash
/opt/VirtBKP/backup_vm.py /opt/VirtBKP/default.conf webserver

```

## Create backup choosing disk
In order to create backups of virtual machines choosing the disk you should use the syntax bellow:
```bash
/opt/VirtBKP/backup_vm__disk.py <configuration_file> <vm_name> <disk_id>

```
Example:
```bash
/opt/VirtBKP/backup_vm_disk.py /opt/VirtBKP/default.conf vm-oracle 3d75ba0a-4712-4d77-be13-7ba37583cdcc

```
In order to list all the vms's boot disk 
```bash
/opt/VirtBKP/list_vms_disk.py /opt/VirtBKP/default.conf <datacenter_name> <cluster_name>
```

## Create backup whole Datacenter
In order to create backups of the whole Datacenter you should use the sysntax bellow:
```bash
/opt/VirtBKP/backup_dc.py <configuration_file> <datacenter_name>

```
Example:
```bash
/opt/VirtBKP/backup_dc.py /opt/VirtBKP/default.conf Produzione
```

#### Restore backup
In order to restore an existing backup you should use the syntax bellow:
```bash
/opt/VirtBKP/upload_disk.py <configuration_file> <qcow2_file>
```
Example
```bash
/opt/VirtBKP/upload_disk.py /mnt/webserver_2017-04-28-00h.qcow2
```
